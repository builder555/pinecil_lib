## Contribution guidelines

Fork the repo, make your changes, then create a PR.

When creating new commits, use the following prefixes in your commit messages:
* `fix:` for small changes - updates patch version
* `feat:` for new features or larger changes - updates minor version
* `fix!` or `feat!` for breaking changes - updates major version

Ensure your PR addresses an open issue or a feature request.

__No meaningless PRs or noise please!__
